## Tech used

1. React Native Expo to build the UI for our app.
2. Restcountries API to get and display the countries data in the app.
3. React navigation to handle our routes.
4. Expo vector icons for our icons.

## API used

The Restcountries API contains information about countries via a RESTful API. It was inspired on [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu) by Fayder Florez.

## How to run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate into the cloned folder and run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies and then `npm start` to start the local dev server.

## Prerequisites to run

### Running on an emulator

1. Have Android Studio downloaded and configured: i.e. you have an emulator in Android Studio that React Native can use to install and run your app.

### Running on your physical device: Android

1. Download Expo Go on your device.
2. Start your local dev server using `npm start`.
3. Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal using Expo Go.

### Running on your physical device: iPhone

1. Start your local dev server using `npm start`.
2. Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal using the Camera app.

# What next?

There's still so much data available in the API that you can use to improve this application such as a country's population, its neighbours, and even its area.
